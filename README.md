Welcome to the open-source companion repository for the paper  
**"Parameter Optimization and Noise Resilience Analysis for QAOA on NISQ Devices"**  
by *Forgotten Forge*.


---

## üåê Overview

This repository accompanies the research on **quantum algorithm optimization** and **noise resilience analysis** across real NISQ hardware platforms (IQM Garnet, Rigetti Ankaa-3, IonQ Forte-1).  
It provides the complete framework, experimental protocols, and analysis tools used in the study.

The work explores:
- Empirical **parameter optimization** for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
- Strategic **dynamical decoupling (DD)** placement for Grover‚Äôs algorithm
- Introduction of the **critical noise threshold (œÉc)** as a quantitative resilience metric
- **Cross-platform validation** and reproducibility across superconducting and ion-trap hardware

## üß† What You'll Find Here

- Full experimental framework, data workflows, and analysis scripts  
- Reproducible setups for both **simulator** and **hardware** execution  
- The **SigmaCSuite** open-source toolkit for measuring noise resilience  
- Reproducibility details including statistical methods and parameter tuning protocols  
- [Sigma C Rust Live Demo](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=d8c088f6eaeb5c421674154e3ea40653)

ü§ù Collaboration and Industry Partnerships

We warmly welcome collaboration with quantum technology companies and research institutions interested in extending or integrating the framework into their workflows.
Our goal is to bridge academic research and practical quantum development by jointly improving algorithmic optimization and validation tools for NISQ-era hardware.

If your team is exploring hardware-specific algorithm tuning, noise characterization, or hybrid quantum-classical optimization, we‚Äôd be glad to discuss joint experiments or integration projects.

## Troubleshooting

- Braket not installed:
    
    `pip install amazon-braket-sdk` and configure AWS credentials.
    
- DD gets ‚Äúoptimized away‚Äù:
    
    Ensure barriers are inserted; verify post‚Äëtranspile gate counts and depth.
    
- Diverging success rates:
    
    Check calibration window, reduce shots for pilot runs, set simulator seeds, and compare manifests.
